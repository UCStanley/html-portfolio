      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Chima Stanley Ugoeze. I am a web developer and this is my very first project.</p>
      
      <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in International Business from University of London.
        I also have a Master's degree in International Marketing from University of Surrey, both in the UK.</p>
      
      <p>I developed interest in Web Development and decided to take a course on that. 
        I started the course October 2023 and this is my first attempt in building a HTML-only website. 
        I hope to remain steadfast and complete the course in order to step into the exciting world of Web Development.</p>
      
      <p>I look forward to becoming an expert and getting hired by a prestigious firm where my skills will be put to use.</p>
      
      <p>See you at the top... Cheers.</p>
